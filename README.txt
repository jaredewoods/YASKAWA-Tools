# KLA Alarm Code Search

This project is a simple GUI created with Tkinter that provides the ability to search for alarm codes in a CSV database. It focuses on KLA alarm codes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you setup a copy of the project and run on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3 and these python libraries installed on your system

- tkinter
- pandas

To install these libraries, you can use pip command like so:

pip install pandas

And Tkinter comes out of the box with Python for Windows, MacOS and Linux, so we don't need to install it.

### Running the script

Download the script and run it with Python

python alarm_code_search.py

## Using the GUI

The GUI asks for two inputs:

- ALARM
- SUBCODE

Enter these two inputs and press SEARCH.

The GUI will display the Message and Cause associated with the entered alarm code and subcode.
